Now I understand games better than before, so when I looked at game mods or game files, I could make some sense of them, even before starting the Software Engineering Bootcamp at General Assembly. I had no knowledge of coding, but I sure had knowledge of games, and I could use that knowledge to know what the code does. Once I realised that this - the concept of trial and error and always messing with things until they do what you want them to - was essentially coding, I was determined to learn how to code and find a career in it!</p>
